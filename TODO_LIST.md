## Todo
* Fix Open Weather API (for now, we just fetch weather's data of only one location based on its coordinates and show its weather's icon on Map, not for a set of locations around this current coordinates)
* RapidAPI for **Travel Advisor** is limited (...)
* Add a "Welcome page" for app
* From Map page, add a button to add / create a list of trip for collaboration
* Database's architecture
